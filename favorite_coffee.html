<h1>My Favorite Coffee Drink</h1>
<p title="Latte Coffee Review">
    My favorite coffee is the standard latte.  A latte is just a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.  I like mine with the standard two shots of espresso and I like the milk steamed to where it's not too frothy and where you can feel a little some weight when holding the cup.  Some baristas are known to over steam the milk to where the latte is full of mostly foam and the drink is very light.
